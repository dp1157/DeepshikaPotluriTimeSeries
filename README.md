- This contains Assignment 1: Importing and Playing with Excel File in R

Class

In the folder "Class 2" there is a file called "Typical_Employee_Survey_Data.xlsx". 

In R Studio, you can import Excel/CSV files under the file section. Save your Excel file as CSV and use the CSV option. Make sure you deselect the "first row as names" checkbox since your file does not have headers. Importing the file is worth 10 points. 

You will write R functions to 

1. Add Header Row (10 points)

2. Print out the 5-point summary and boxplot (numerical columns) for each column (20 points)

3. Convert the columns that need to be converted to Factors (10 points)

4. Plot the right visual for each column (20 points)

5. Plot scatter plots to show few relationships (20 points)

6. Submit the homework (rmd and HTML file) in GitHub (10 points)

Please explain the main takeaway for each visual.
