# scatter plot: Age vs. Years Worked at the company
plot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Age, Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Years_Worked, main = "Age vs. Years Worked", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Years Worked at the Company")
##Obviously people who have worked at the company for a long time are older. However there are some older indivduals who have only worked at the company for under 15 years. Most employees under 45 have worked at the company for 20 or less years.

# scatter plot: Years Worked at the company vs Satisfaction
plot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Years_Worked, Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Satisfcation, main = "Years Worked vs. Satisfaction", xlab = "Years Worked", ylab = "Satisfaction")
##Overall no matter how long people have worked at the company they are likely to be satisfied with their job. However people who have worked at the company for 25+ years are moderately satisfied and very satisfied.

# scatter plot: Years Worked at the company vs. Promotion Likeliness
plot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Years_Worked, Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Promotion, main = "Years Worked vs. Promotion Likeliness", xlab = "Years Worked", ylab = "Promotion Likeliness")
## The longer people work for the company the more they feel it is unlikely that they get a promotion. Employees who have only worked at the company for under 10 years feel that they are either likely or unlikely to be promoted.

# scatter plot: Years Worked at the company vs. Loyalty
plot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Years_Worked, Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Loyalty, main = "Years Worked vs. Loyalty", xlab = "Years Worked", ylab = "Loyalty")
## People who worked at the company for under 5 years are slightly more unlikely to turn down a higher paying job. However people who have worked at the company for longer are equally likely to stay loyal or take a higher paying job.

# Scatter plot: Age vs. Loyalty
plot(Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Age, Typical_Employee_Survey_Data$Loyalty, main = "Age vs. Loyalty", xlab = "Age", ylab = "Loyalty")
##Age does not seem to have an effect on loyalty to the company, there seems to be an even split of opinions across the different age ranges. Most employees regardless of age said they would be unlikely to turn down a higher paying job to stay at the company.

#Overall takeaway: The analysis of the "Typical Employee Survey Data" reveals interesting patterns among employee attributes. The relationship between years worked and job satisfaction shows that long-tenured employees tend to be satisfied, while shorter-tenure employees are more likely to be very satisfied. Additionally, employees with fewer years at the company tend to feel more likely to receive promotions, while those with longer tenures show decreased promotion expectations. Furthermore, age does not seem to significantly impact loyalty, as employees across different age groups have similar responses regarding their willingness to stay or leave the company for a better-paying job.
